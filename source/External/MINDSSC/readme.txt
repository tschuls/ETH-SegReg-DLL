 Some modifications by Tobias Gass, mainly to allow for using the
 similarity metrics from c++ applications other than the original
 package. This repository also only includes the files necessary for
 that, if you are interested in the full code as originally
 distributed, please contact Matthias Heinrich.

 Tested with g++ on Mac OS X and Linux Ubuntu, compile with:
 
 g++ WBIR_SSC.cpp -O3 -lpthread -msse4.2 -o wbirSSC
 g++ WBIR_LCC.cpp -O3 -lpthread -msse4.2 -o wbirLCC
 
 replace msse4.2 by your current SSE version if needed
 for Windows you might need MinGW or CygWin

 This is intended for research purposes only and should not be used in clinical applications (no warranty)!

 
 You should give three filenames (only plain nifti format is supported) as input input_vol1.nii input_vol2.nii output_vol (no .nii for output), see help (-h) for details.

 Example usage: ./wbirSSC -F case1_fixed.nii -M case1_moving.nii -O output_case1_ssc
 Default parameter settings: -l 3 -L 6x4x2 -s 1 -g 0.6

 If you find any bugs or have questions please don’t hesitate to contact me by email.
